        <p>A paragraph is an example of block-level element.</p>
        <p>Block level elements are displayed in a new line and they take 100% of the width.</p>
        <p>Anchor tag is an example of inline element - <a href="http://www.google.com">Click here</a> to get to the GOOGLE. Inline elements have their width defined by the width of the content they hold. They don't get displayed in a new line and they don't force any other elemnt to get display in a new line.</p>
